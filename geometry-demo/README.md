# BU RISE Data Science Practicum Lab 4 - Geometry Demo

This is a Python lab exploring various geometrical components including different shapes and their areas. The program also computes the stats for areas of squares and circles, including mean, min, and max. This is done to verify the accuracy and variability in the different area calculations being conducted. The program can be added on to in order to calculate the areas of other shapes, such as rectangles, triangles, trapezoids, etc.
